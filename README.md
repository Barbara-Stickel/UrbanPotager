# UrbanPotager

This project aims to build an interior garden which recreates the exterior conditions necessary to grow plants. A Raspberry Pi controls the irrigation, the light and provides information to the user. The user can choose the light and the number of watering that he wants per day through the interace of the website. 

The project has been realized by Clément Cabot, Omar Benfeddoul and Barbara Stickel as part of our long term project at CentraleSupélec.
